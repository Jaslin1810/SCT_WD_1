    <h1 style="margin-top: 100px;color: rgb(33, 66, 23);">WHAT I DO</h1>
    <p style="margin-top: 50px; text-align: center;color: black;">I am currently a student studying Computer Science Engineering (CSE), with a strong passion for web development. My academic focus has given me a solid foundation in programming, algorithms, and data structures, but I am particularly drawn to the world of front-end and back-end web development. I enjoy creating interactive and user-friendly websites, and I am constantly learning new frameworks, tools, and languages like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React to stay ahead in the ever-evolving field. My goal is to design and build seamless web experiences that not only look great but also function efficiently and effectively.

      In addition to my studies, I actively work on personal web development projects and contribute to open-source communities to gain hands-on experience. I find great satisfaction in tackling challenges like optimizing page performance, implementing responsive designs, and integrating APIs to enhance user experience. I’m also fascinated by the backend side of web development, where I explore databases, server-side scripting, and cloud technologies. Through my ongoing learning and practical experience, I aim to build a portfolio that showcases my skills and ultimately pursue a career where I can contribute to creating innovative web solutions that impact users globally.
